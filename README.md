Vulnerability discovery processï¼š

The system has a log export function. When exporting, the data package contains two parameters, sql and tab. The sql parameter is the URL and base64-encoded SQL query statement, and tab is the table to be operated on.

So operations can be performed at these two parameters.

Query statement 

```sql
select * from information_schema.SCHEMATA --
```

After encoding, pass in the parameter sql and modify the tab.

At this time, you can see that the content of the information_schema.SCHEMATA table has been queried, and I have deleted the cookie, and the content can still be queried. Therefore, it is determined that the interface is unauthorized and SQL injection can be performed.
